# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Preparing for the bootcamp could become taxing for some students, so I created a webpage to track and keep notes of the following subjects that were covered:

- HTML
- CSS
- Git
- JavaScript

## Installation

## Usage

Students can review notes for each of the subjects.

Opening the console in DevTools will give a suggestion for which subject to study first.

Open DevTools using Command+Option+I for MacOS, or Control+Shift+I for Windows, then navigate to the Console tab.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
